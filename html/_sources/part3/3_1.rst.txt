Scrolling down the webpage (:numref:`3.1.2`) will show a list of products with a brief description of each and a link to other webpages specific to each. 
Copernicus EMS On-Demand Mapping **(1)** is a system that can be requested only by authorized users. As the name suggests, this system provides on-demand information over a specific area anywhere in the world. General public can be informed of the activation request and is allowed to download the resulting products as all other Copernicus EMS products. Both Rapid Mapping **(2)** and Risk and Recovery Mapping **(3)** can be retrieved from the `Copernicus EMS mapping page <https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/>`_ . Copernicus Rapid Mapping is meant to provide in a short time period while Copernicus Risk and Recovery Mapping is meant to contribute to prevention, preparedness, disaster risk reduction and recovery phases of emergency management and their production and does not imply immediate response.

Copernicus EMS Early warning & monitoring **(1)** (:numref:`3.1.4`) is a system aimed to offer geospatial information based on observations and forecasting. It splits into the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) **(2)**, the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) **(3)** and the European and Global Drought Observatories (EDO) (GDO) **(4)**. Each subsection has its own website and it deals with different aspects. In particular the EFAS is aimed to support the prevention procedures in case of flooding events. EFFIS provides information about wildfires over Europe and is also supported by a group of experts scattered throughout 43 European countries. EDO and GDO provides information about drought gained through maps of indicators built combining different sources of information like soil and moisture models, precipitation measurements and satellite measures.

List of Activations
*******************

An exhaustive and continuously updated list of EMS rapid mapping activations can be found `here <https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-activations-risk-and-recovery>`_ (:numref:`3.1.1.2`) . And can be reached by clicking on **List of Activations (1)**. Activations are classified by countries, dates and event type. Between the event types we can notice floods, earthquakes, wildfires and many more. Also notice that there can be more than one product per each activation and area of interest.

Available Products
******************

There are four kinds of Copernicus EMS Rapid Mapping products: Reference products, First Estimate Product (FEP), Delineation products and Grading products ( we will see them in :ref:`chapter 3.1.2 <Download flooded area delineation map>` ). The first one is designed to provide information about the territory before the event while the FEP is designed to assess the most affected areas in the fastest way possible by providing the first available post-event image. In this lecture we will focus on the other two types.

.. note:: you can read more about the Rapid Mapping Portfolio by clicking on this `link <https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/ems/rapid-mapping-portfolio>`_ .

**Delineation Map**

The aim of Delineation Maps is to give an in- depth assessment of the event impact and extent. It can also be requested to provide an update of the situation by monitoring. Those maps are derived from images acquired as soon as possible after the emergency event. Delivery times for the data can be delivered as soon as 7 hrs after the request.

**Grading Map**

These products are aimed to provide information about the damage grade, impact extent and spatial distribution. As for Delineation maps, monitoring requests can be submitted. It is important to note that this product is derived from the Delineation maps.

Import EMS vector data in QGIS
******************************

Ensure that the downloaded **Vector Package** folder is unzipped. Inside the downloaded folder you will see many files with different extensions (:numref:`3.1.3.2`) , for the purpose of this lecture we are just interested in shapefiles, other extensions will be explained in later chapters. Typically when we refer to “shapefile'' we are talking about a collection of files with different extensions in which the main one is a .shp file **(1)** that contains the geometry (points, lines, or polygons) of the features. The other two main files composing a shapefile are the .shx which is an index file and the .dbf which stores attribute data.

.. note:: To have a more technical and in depth explanation of the shapefile data format you can refer to the `ESRI Shapefile Technical Description <https://support.esri.com/en-us/technical-paper/esri-shapefile-technical-description-279>`_ .

**Single symbol style**

We will now change the style of our layers, starting with the “EMSR468_AOI05_DEL_PRODUCT_areaOfInterestA_r1_v1” layer (:numref:`3.1.3.5`) . Of the area affected by the event we are studying we only need to highlight the border/edge, there is no other information. Therefore, we want to display it with a simple well-defined border (red colour). Let’s see how to do so.
Double click on the layer mentioned above or right click on it **(1)** and select **Properties (2)**. The Layer Properties panel will appear, select **Symbology (3)**, then **Single Symbol (4)**. At this point choose the **outline red** style **(5)** and click on **ok (6)**.

.. _3.1.3.5:

   -- Single symbol style

**Categorized style**

It is now the turn of the “EMSR468_AOI05_DEL_PRODUCT_hydrographyA_r1_v1” layer (:numref:`3.1.3.6`) . The hydrography layer if represented with a single colour (i.e. a single category) provides no further information. Represented instead in a different style, it allows more details to be displayed.
As before, open the symbology property by right-clicking on **(1)** then select **Properties (2)** and **Symbology (3)**. This time change the style to **Categorize (4)** and set the Value field as **obj_type (5)**. Click on **classify (6)** and optionally, change the colors **(7)**. When you are satisfied click on **ok (8)**. You can see that there are three different categories related to the hydrography: lake, river and reservoir, which are now also distinct in their representation.

**Feature labels**

Open the Layer Properties panel of the layer: “EMSR468_AOI05_DEL_PRODUCT_hydrographyL_r1_v1” **(1)** (:numref:`3.1.3.8`) .
In the case of hydrography information with 'lines', this represents the position of watercourses in the area being considered. It is interesting to associate these elements (if available) with their names. this is done by operating on the “labels”
Choose the **Labels** tab **(2)** and select **Single Labels (3)** from the drop down menu. Now select the field that will be used to label our data in the map canvas by choosing “name” in the Value field **(4)**. Select Text **(5)** in order to modify the text style of the label and set the font **Size** to 5.0 **(6)**.
If you click on **Apply (7)** and move the Layer Properties panel in order to be able to look at the map canvas, you will see that it is difficult to read our labels at first glance, in the next step we will see how to fix this issue.

   -- Feature labels Text

Go back to the Layer Properties panel and click on Background **(1)** (:numref:`3.1.3.9`) . Enable it by ticking the **Draw background** box **(2)** and selecting a color of your choice in the color ramp **(3)** in the color bar, keep in mind that the text color is black, so choosing darker tones will make it harder to see. Adding a background will partially cover what is underneath the text of our labels but it will make the text much more readable.

**Graduated style**

We will now modify the style of the “EMSR468_AOI05_DEL_PRODUCT_observedEventA_r1_v1” layer **(1)** (:numref:`3.1.3.11`) . 
The observed event we are considering is a flood.  The territory is not affected by the flood in a constant manner (single colour): there are areas that are more exposed and others that are less, so a visualisation that takes this into account is necessary.
Open the **Symbology** tab and select **Graduated (2)** from the drop down menu. Choose “area” in the Value field **(3)**, our objective will be to visualize flooded areas with different colors based on their size. Select a color ramp of your choice **(4)**. In our dataset we have a lot of small areas and only a few big ones, given this distribution we can select the **Logarithmic Scale** or **Natural Breaks (Jenks)** mode **(5)** in order to enhance the distance between classes. Set the number of classes to 15 **(6)** and click on **Classify (7)** you will see the preview of the classification in the preview panel **(8)**. When you are satisfied click on **ok (9)**.

If you are satisfied with a style and you want to save it in order to use it in the future, you can click on **Style (1)** (:numref:`3.1.3.13`) in the **Symbology** panel of the **Layer Properties** and select **Save Style (2)** from the menu that will open up. In the new window that will open you can select in which format you want to save your file **(3)** and have a preview of which categories will be saved **(4)**, you will also have the possibility to deactivate the ones you are not interested in by clicking on the ticked boxes, but we are not interested in doing so now. By clicking on the three dots **(5)** you will be able to navigate your folders and choose the path where to save your style, when you are done click on ok **(6)**.

Attribute table
***************

Usually when we work on vector data we have access to an attribute table (:numref:`3.1.3.14`) , this table will display information on the features of the chosen layer. We will now look at the attribute table of the “EMSR468_AOI05_DEL_PRODUCT_observedEventA_r1_v1” layer **(1)** In order to open it we need to right click on the layer and select **Open Attribute Table (2)** between the various options. The attribute table **(3)** will be displayed, here we can see the attributes composing our layer represented as the columns headlines **(4)**, each row representing an entry.
On top of the attribute table we have some buttons offering different options:

+ Toggle editing mode **(5)**
+ Reload the table **(6)**
+ Select features using an Expression **(7)**
+ Select All **(8)**
+ Invert selection **(9)**
+ Deselect all **(10)**
+ Filter/Select features using form **(11)**
+ Move selected to top **(12)**
+ Pan map to the selected rows **(13)**
+ Zoom map to the selected rows **(14)**
+ Organize Columns **(15)**
+ Open field calculator **(16)**
+ Conditional formatting **(17)**
+ Actions **(18)**
+ Dock Attribute Table **(19)**

**Select the largest area affected by flood**

In order to select the largest area affected by the flood we can click on the “area” attribute of the attribute table **(1)** (:numref:`3.1.3.15`) , since the values are numerical, data will be automatically sorted by decreasing values thus the largest area will be represented in the first row. Clicking again on the same attribute will sort data by increasing order. We will now click on the corresponding row number in order to select our feature **(2)**. Now that we have performed our selection we can right click anywhere on our selected feature **(3)** and select **Zoom to Feature (4)**, this will zoom the map canvas over our feature. Alternatively, since we have performed a selection, we can click on the **Zoom map to the selected rows (5)** .

   -- Largest area affected by flood

**Calculate the total area affected**

In order to perform computations we can use the Field Calculator (:numref:`3.1.3.16`) . First we click on **Toggle editing mode (1)** and then on the **Field Calculator** button **(2)** to open it.
The first thing we will do is to thick the **Create virtual field** box **(3)**, then we give a name to the new column which will host the result of our computation, in this case, “Total_Area” **(4)**. We set the **Output Field Type** to “Decimal” **(5)** since setting it to “Integer” will remove all values after the comma. Since we want to sum all values of the area field searched for the sum function in the search bar by typing “sum” **(6)**, once found, click on it twice to add it to the expression tab (we will look at it later). On the right of the Field Calculator an in depth explanation of how the chosen function works will open up **(7)**. Click on **Fields and Values (8)** to open the curtain menu and double click on “area” **(9)**. Now you will need to complete the formula in the expression tab by adding a closing bracket “ ) ” **(10)**. Alternatively you could have just typed the formula inside the expression tab as: “ sum( "area" ) ” (removing the external quotation marks). If you have written the formula in the correct form you should see a **Preview** of the result **(11)**. In this case we just need these values because we can still conclude the procedure by clicking on **ok (12)**.
