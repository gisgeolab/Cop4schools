What is the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)
================================================

`Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) <https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php>`_  is an open and free data and tool for assessing the human presence on the planet. The project aims to produce and analyse global built-up surface, population density and human settlement thematic maps to understand human presence on Planet Earth. The GHSL processing framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of high-resolution satellite imagery, census data, and geographic information provided by the community. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and precisely about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. In particular, GHS-POP is composed of a spatial raster dataset representing the number of people per cell. These estimations were done every 5 years between 1975 and 2020 and are also available projections for the years 2025 and 2030.
Once you have opened the `GHSL website <https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php>`_ you will be greeted by its homepage (:numref:`6.1.1.1`) . From the menu on top of the homepage **(1)** you can reach other sections of the website that will be explained in the following chapter. The three main pages of the website: **Data and tools**, **Visual analytics** and **Degree of urbanisation** can be also reached using the dedicated section **(2)**.

Scrolling down the webpage (:numref:`6.1.1.2`) you will see first a series of links leading to technical aspects, projects and definitions which will be discussed later **(1)**. Under that section, the latest news, events and publications are presented **(2)**. Finally, with a blue background, there is a list of contacts of the institutions involved in the project along with policy and legal notes **(3)**.

From the homepage, we can open the Copernicus page (:numref:`6.1.1.3`) by clicking on **Copernicus (1)**. The page contents are listed on the left side of the page **(2)**. By clicking on the internal links on that section the page will automatically scroll to the desired argument. Apart from a brief introduction to Copernicus and GHSL. There is also a section dedicated to the CESM week which is an annual user workshop regarding Copernicus ESM and talking about the service's purpose, its milestones, the contributing partners but also innovations, updated functionalities and added capabilities.

Clicking on **Degree of Urbanisation (1)** (:numref:`6.1.1.14`) will open a page from which it is possible to open other pages, each dedicated to a different resource with the common topic of the degree of urbanization. The same pages can be reached from the drop-down menu of the **Degree of Urbanisation** button.
The “**Why a Global Definition?**” page explains the importance of having a global, people-based definition of cities, urban and rural areas. Other than being a request inside the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is explained that there are many benefits to having a harmonized method. In particular, the proposed method utilises three classes to classify the territory: cities, towns, semi-dense areas and rural areas. Examples of the benefits of this classification are the capability of aggregating data collections, allowing to capture the urban-rural continuum and reducing the distortions created by the variable size of statistical and administrative units (this is because the proposed method is based on a population grid). With this method, it is also possible to directly capture the people's concentration instead of retrieving it indirectly from other data such as the built-up areas.  
The **Definition** page, also called **Settlement classification** in the drop-down menu, shows examples of classification explaining the adapted thresholds.
