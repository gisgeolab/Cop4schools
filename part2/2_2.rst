Display satellite images(s) in Copernicus Browser
=================================================

Display satellite images(s) with true colors
--------------------------------------------

By default `Copernicus Browser <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ displays a **True color** image :numref:`2.2.1.1`; True color is a combination of Red, Green, and Blue, for Sentinel-2, they can be found in band 4, band 3, and band 2 ( :ref:`further information about Sentinel-2 < Link to Why Sentinel-2 “4.1.1”>`). Thus, Earth’s surface is shown as humans would see it naturally. All the layers come with a description. To expand the window and read it click on **(1)**.

Calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index 
-----------------------------------------------

The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), is used to map water bodies. The index is calculated using a combination of the near infrared (NIR) and Green spectral bands.

Integrated Visualization functionality of Copernicus Browser
************************************************************

Combinations of bands that represent layers, are already prepared for you in `Copernicus Browser <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ , to switch among them, just click on the desired index.
Visualizations by means of indices are listed below **True color**. To view the **NDWI** in `Copernicus Browser <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ (:numref:`2.2.2.1`), click on **NDWI** in the left panel **(1)**.

**Zoom in to Vercelli**

Use the zoom functionality focusing on “Vercelli” to have an idea where the water bodies are (:numref:`2.2.2.2`).

Indices in `Copernicus Browser <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ come with a legend. This represents the key of understanding the Satellite image. An example of legend relative to the NDWI is reported in :numref:`2.2.2.3`.

Indices computation functionality of Copernicus Browser
*******************************************************

`Copernicus Browser <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ offers the possibility to make calculations based on bands, thus the ability to calculate indices yourself by applying equations (:ref:`Indeces formulas <Image Analysis>`). To obtain the **NDWI** click on **Custom (1)**. (:numref:`2.2.2.4`)

   -- Navigate to start NDWI calculation

Now click on **Index (1)** (:numref:`2.2.2.5`) and apply the NDWI equation by dragging the corresponding bands **(2)** into the equation **(3)**. Finally, change the color scheme by clicking on **Threshold (4)**, which will drop down multiple styles, and choose among them the one you like. We will move now to the next section, click on **Back (5)**.

3D Satellite image visualization in Copernicus Browser
------------------------------------------------------
We will now see how to get a 3D visualization of our True Color Layer (:numref:`2.2.3.1`), in order to do so click on the **3D** icon on the right **(1)**, once you have done it the symbol on the icon will change and will allow you to go back to a 2D visualization.
Move yourself in the 3D space using the pan console **(2)** and the camera console **(3)**.
Click on setting **(4)** and increase the **Vertical terrain scaling (5)** in order to make more visible the difference in height of the terrain.
